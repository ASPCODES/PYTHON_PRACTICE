# Q2. Take two numbers as input from the user and print their sum, difference, and product.

# Taking input from user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2  
difference = num1 - num2
product    = num1 * num2

print(f"sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"difference: {difference}")
print(f"product: {product}")
